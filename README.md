# NLP Content-Based Movie Recommendations

## Introduction

This project implements content-based movie recommendations using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as Bag of Words (BoW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), and Cosine Similarity score. 
The aim is to recommend movies similar to a given movie based on their textual descriptions.

## Features

- Utilizes movie descriptions to create a numerical representation using BoW and TF-IDF.
- Calculates the similarity between movies using Cosine Similarity.
- Provides recommendations based on the similarity scores.


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project should contain at least two columns: title and description. Ensure that the descriptions are cleaned and preprocessed before using them for recommendations.
